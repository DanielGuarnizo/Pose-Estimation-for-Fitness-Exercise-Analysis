# ProjectCV
This project presents a computer vision-based approach for analysing fitness exercises, specifically focusing on the squat, deadlift and bench press movements.
We leverage the MediaPipe framework to obtain landmark positions from video data and employ Scikit-learn to train models for the primary task of distinguishing between phases of an exercise repetition. These models serve as the foundation for achieving the main objectives of our system: repetition counting and exercise quality assessment.
